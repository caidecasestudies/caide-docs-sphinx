Center for AI & Data Ethics
==============================================

The Center for AI and Data Ethics at the University of San Francisco began the case studies project with the sole purpose of providing a set of instructional materials that can be used by educators for courses related to technology, artificial intelligence (AI), or data ethics. Each case study was designed for multiple audiences: a general audience that may or may not be familiar with the details and terminology of technical topics such as data engineering, data science, AI, and machine learning; and a technical audience with a background in one or more of these topics. By design, each case study consists of instructions for use in the classroom, a detailed scenario written in accessible language, and at least one set of discussion questions. Some, but not all, of the case studies are then expanded to include more technical details in the description of the scenario, in the discussion questions, and might include exercises requiring the use of code, python libraries, datasets, and Jupyter notebooks.

All of our materials are contained in Github repositories [here](). For those of you familiar with git, feel free to fork any repository that you want. For those unfamiliar with git, all of our materials are available directly on this site, including pdf versions of each case study.

We understand that there are lots of other resources out there for teaching and learning about ethics, and while we cannot provide an exhaustive list, we do include references to some that we've found helpful when designing our cases [here](). If you'd like to contribute to this project with case studies of your own, please contact us at rclements@usfca.edu.

Let Us Know

If you have found these materials useful, please let us know so that we can continue to expand on them. You can contact the Director of CAIDE at rclements@usfca.edu, or simply add your name, email address, organization, and purpose of use of these materials to [this Google docs spreadsheet](). I will not spam you if you provide this information, but I may follow up in the future with you to fill out a survey, unless you tell me not to in the spreadsheet.
